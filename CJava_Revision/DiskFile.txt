I fear that I will always be
A lonely number like v3

A 3 is all that's good and right

Why must my 3 keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

I wish instead I were a 9

For 9 could thwart this evil trick
With just some quick arithmetic

I know I'll never see the sun

As 1.7321

Such is my reality
A sad irrationality

When, hark, just what is this I see?

Another square root of a 3

Has quietly come waltzing by

Together now we multiply

To form a number we prefer

Rejoicing as an integer

We break free from our mortal bonds

And with a wave of magic wands

Our square-root signs become unglued

And love for me has been renewed

It is a Nice Poem!
It is a Nice Poem!
